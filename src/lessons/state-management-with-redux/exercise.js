/**
 * Use this module to practice managing your component state completely externally,
 * using the redux and react-redux libraries to read from a global state tree and
 * apply a set of props and actions to your component. The 'styles' and 'ItemsList'
 * are provided for you, as well as the redux store, constants, and reducer files
 * and implementations. The function definitions have been set up for you in the
 * action creators/handlers files, but will need the implementations written. Then
 * all you need to do is flesh out your mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps items
 * and connect your component.
 *
 * If you finish early, and want to try something more advanced, you'll find another
 * block of code commented out below. See if you can figure out how to implement your
 * own. It creates its own internal Provider/Consumer context pair of components, but
 * exports that context as { ReactReduxContext }, so you can make use of it yourself.
 * Remember that whenever a component is 'connect'ed, it will need access to the store
 * object that's been passed to its top-level Provider, in order to subscribe to it
 * for state updates, and will need to return a new component that renders the target
 * component with all of the appropriate state and action values as props. Also bear
 * in mind that it will need to have a way to assign the incoming action functions to
 * be piped through the store, and will also need to eventually unsubscribe from store
 * updates, to prevent memory leaks when the component is eventually destroyed. If you
 * get lost, you'll also find a solution to this portion down below the regular solution.
 *
 * You'll find some example components below. Use them for inspiration of brainstorming
 * purposes. See what you can come up with, and how best to relay data between them.
