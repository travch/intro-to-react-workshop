/**
 * Use this module to practice writing compound components, components that can receive
 * a list of children and apply some kind of special behavior or style or anything else
 * to them in a managed fashion, without having to know anything about it. Some examples
 * might include a managed RadioGroup of components that are not actually using radio
 * form elements under the hood, or a Magnifier component that applies a :hover style
 * to all of its children to scale them up as the user mouses over them.
 *
 * You'll find some example components below. Use them to brainstorm ideas on how to
 * solve the problem at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * const RadioButton = ({ checked, children, onClick, value }) => (
 *   <div className="radio-button" onClick={() => onClick(value)}>
 *     <span className="icon" /> {children}
 *   </div>
 * );
 *
 * const RadioGroup = class extends React.Component {
 *   _onClick = value => {
 *     if (value !== this.props.value) {
 *       this.props.onChange(value);
 *     }
 *   };
 *
 *   render() {
 *     const { children, value } = this.props;
 *
 *     return (
 *       <div className="radio-group">
 *         {React.Children.map(children, child => React.cloneElement(child, {
 *           ...child.props,
 *           onClick: this._onClick,
 *           selected: child.props.value === value,
 *         }))}
 *       </div>
 *     );
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * const AgeRangeRadioGroup = ({ value }) => {
 *   <RadioGroup value={value}>
 *     <RadioButton value="13-17">13 - 17 years old</RadioButton>
 *     <RadioButton value="18-24">18 - 24 years old</RadioButton>
 *     <RadioButton value="25-39">25 - 39 years old</RadioButton>
 *     <RadioButton value="40-59">40 - 59 years old</RadioButton>
 *     <RadioButton value="60+">60 years or older</RadioButton>
 *   </RadioGroup>
 * };
 *
 * See if you can figure out how to make this JobPipeline component work properly. It should
 * take a list of child components that each perform some kind of asynchronous task (the task
 * itself is unimportant for this project, and will be supplied by a service function in this
 * scenario. The goal is to have the JobPipeline component only mount 1 child component at a
 * time, and wait for that component to signal back that its job has been completed before it
 * mounts the next component in the pipeline. The Job component is already written for you,
 * and simply waits for its timeToComplete to expire through the CountdownService, at which
 * time, it should alert the JobPipeline component that it's completed, passing its jobId.

/**

 * or React.Children.toArray, React.cloneElement, and some way of tracking
 * how many items have finished processing, so that you know which components
 * to mount and activate.
